## Files

* `CodeBook.Rmd` a code book that describes the modifications made to the raw data. Additionally, contains indentifiers and measurements of the tidy data set.
* `run_analysis.R` extract raw data and modifies it according to the steps described in the course project requirements.
* `tidy Dataset.txt` exported data with the means of the tidy data set.

## Projects Requirements

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
